## Development Setup

Set up the env variables by copying `./sample.dev.env` to `./.env`. You can alter the variables here, eg. debug mode or the selenium browser mode (headful/headless).

### A. In container (recommended)

In the main directory run
```sh
docker compose up
```
As always, you might need to add a `--build` flag to build the image for the first time.

#### Issues

‚ùó Sometimes logging to Amazon does not work, but after container restart everything is fine.

### B. Locally

1. Install requirements for Python 3.10:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Install Chrome for Selenium drivers.
3. Run the app
```bash
cd app
streamlit run runapp.py
```
